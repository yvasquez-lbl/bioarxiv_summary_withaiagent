# bioarxiv_summary_withaiagent


This is a temporary code with an ai agent needed to be a NeLLi Research assistant.

Currently this code has a lot of requirements, including a cborg api key needed. If run locally, then that would remove the need for a cborg api key.

It can also only find one paper. To see this paper use the command:
find paper from [author last name only] from April 1st, 2025 to April 1st, 2025.

You can then use this paper to summarize it into a 300 word bluesky post. 
You can also use the paper to generate a prompt for an image (running it locally with an image generator would solve this).
